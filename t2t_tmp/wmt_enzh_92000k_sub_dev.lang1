I'm going to have to treat you as bad as I treat him or even worse.
So what do you think you're gonna do?
All right? It's never happened to us, and every time I try and talk to you about it, - you're running out the door.  - 'Cause I'd rather be at the gym.
I haven't been back here since...
There wasn't nothing behind those eyes.
Most of the time, you won't need it, but if it turns out your target is on to you...

As usual, my son grossly exaggerates the issue.
And I'd say, “Mom, I'm 9. How do I do that?”
Besides, Cody was at the club last night when we blacked it out.
I know. And I'm sure that Dennis did things for William that are best left where they are, but as you said, that was a lifetime ago, Nora.

So now what can I do? How can I help you?
How did you miss that? - Sorry, I got distracted.
it ranges from extremely cold to extremely hot...

She invited us to dinner tonight.

Look, Scotty, I may be able to get an iffy ticket thrown out, but next time, will you please take a cab?
But I can't help you if I'm dead, and he wants you to take the shot.
You know what? I have to go, though, okay? Bye.
l don't need another loser waitress here. Okay, Mac. Okay.
The question is: When victory and defeat, life and death, hang in the balance, what are you capable of?
Yeah, uh, this is Mr. "Vain" talking at you.
Vanek, you want to talk, you'll talk to me.
I am so good, in fact, that I can put it all back, right now, if you let us go.

Please, fiona. I think I know who the thieves are here.
Ah, so this is it-- the kitchen.
What redirect? - You got jokes?
Why is it, if you're the responsible one, every time you run off and you do your spy thing, I got to pick up the pieces?
Well, I thought we were screwed seven ways from Sunday, but you can go ahead and make it eight and nine.
Oh, for god sake. Has everyone in this family lost his mind?
This stuff holds a lot of sentimental value.
Hell no. You blithely push me into a situation where I unknowingly make a jackass of myself?

Don't be a snob, uncle. It's not their fault you never speak to any of them.
I'll make a call, set up a meet.
Well - You tell it, you die. I'm serious.
These are some serious ''NuPont'' fiber-woven bowls.
Plus, we're gonna get some more help -- a little relief from the bullpen.

Then why is it that we're telling everybody that we broke up?
Do you think Mum would have had the baby yesterday if we hadn't moved house?
This is...lovely, even though it's spinning.

Robert, can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure.
We need to find a tall ship, get out on the water, and figure out how our Kraken would take it down.
I'm supposed to fill in the blanks by spotting Bailey's car, so how's that APB coming?
You got him? - yeah, he's safe, but he's not our biggest fan.

I really don't notice what my neighbors do.
What kind of party you got going on in here, huh?
I find a nice, dark hole somewhere to throw you into.

Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. l'm okay.
Is it? How convenient. - What?
All right, you can walk out of here anyway you want.

Uh, pass. You're just a key, Michael.
What you're doing with this event, it's extraordinary.
You know, I thought I was here to land this big deal, and... and instead...
Mom need never know how much of a disappointment you both actually are, unless that's what you want.
You've never seen it?  - No.
Apparently, there's some ukrainian who's very upset about an op you ran in the '90s.

It would be wonderful for the two of you to have some adult time, honey.
This is serious. Somebody came to me at work. There's a job.
How was the drive? - Oh, it wasn't bad.
Figure out what, I may get some leverage against Carla.
No, no, Wade. Drillbit must have done it.
You know, you just do things in a clump
Well, I better get going. But I got just one thing to say.
Barry, I heard about your ex.
I'm bored just hearing about it.
I'm passing the IPsec, sending you the I. P. address now.
It sends us their data and wipes their drives clean.
And this is it, right --no more games? I get my pension back?
Honestly, I just don't understand the guy's appeal.
You know what? You go ahead. Yeah. There you go.
Reed's on schedule. And satellite tracking has him headed your way.
Um, I've got to get back to work, but it's not like you need me there anyway.
Well, it's better than history and physics.
l understand the drill－ keep them waiting－but the natives are getting restless.
I just want to know how the hell they found us in the first place.
Take it up with commander Jackson. He brought us here himself.
You have a collect call from an inmate at Allarod federal penitentiary.
Now, sit down. We're gonna go over a few things.
The thing is, his alibi checks out. I mean, I verified it myself.
Your eyes are even more magnetic in person.
After she's dead, Drew brings Larry the money, and that's when you're gonna...
Most people don't think of the coast guard as being particularly well-armed.
My dad's sad, my mum's sad, you're sad.
Because my butt is killing me. - No.
So... mom's not here. You know, maybe she's not coming.
Then, even a seasoned operative will have the same response as everyone else
to be by his side and, uh, and to have given up some very real part of yourself, your own dreams, so that your mate can save the world.
the thing is, I-I kind of...
I don't want anyone getting hurt. - copy that.
Don't be too hard on him.
It's all right. I...pretended I was some helpless old woman.
I would like to go see Nate's grave one last time before we leave.
Yeah. - Good thing you brought that flashlight.
No, honey. I-- I'm--I'm too busy. I'm sorry.
Kent and Melissa are going to have a little, uh, well-documented transaction going on -- a buy.
I appreciate all of your opinions, but i've told you a million times, I will not win playing dirty.
And you completely overreacted to that little outfit.
Now, the whole idea here is that you will do this one solo, and that way, you can re-establish some kind of a trust with me.
Do you have my memo for the committee?  - Nope.
It's good. We're covered. Don't sweat it.
And she needs your help, man.
Futile, maybe, because you and your partner aren't able to have children biologically?
I had a friend who deals in secondhand cars check it out.
No, no, no. All right, all right.
Oh, and just so you know, you're -- you're pretty much a -- an amateur when it comes to losing game night.
How the hell did you let him escape?
Sam! No! Oh, Fi. Fi! Fi.
Why don't you find something on the radio?
And, well, technically, she's my daughter 'cause I gave sperm to tommy and Julia.
Oh, my god. She's trying to buy us time.
Good, buddy. I'll see you soon. - All right.
And did grandma tell you that Kitty has the best doctors in the whole world, and they're doing everything they can to help her and that she's gonna be just fine?
I'm a junior now, Amma. If I dress like I care, I lose credibility.
I think about it, I get, like, hives.
You got a cop tipping you off? - no, no, no, no, no, no.
No one's asked for any money.
Guys, you need to forget about the hostages. All right?
Well, come on. Before Sarah, I never had any good reason.  - Ooh.
We had a deal -- you surrender, you help with my investigation into this tom card mess.
How big do we want this?
If you've got a better wayto find encrypted passwords and account information, I’m all ears, baby.
I know. I kn... I had to do it.
What the－What is this? Oh. Flip it like that.
Then I got hit in the ear, which you probabIy can't even see,'cause it's so deep in the ear canal.
I know where this is headed. - Don't put words in my mouth.
Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip!
Not after the life you've come to know here.
You know, Catherine, most people consider a year to be the minimum waiting period.
Went to the worst possible version of you.
Why don't you turn it on?
You know, Nate, I'll bet Michael's thinking the same thing about you.
I was in my apartment. -- Shh, shh, shh. Milo.
I leave for ten minutes to get macadamia nuts, and it's like you take away her will to live.
I bet you're wearing a wire.
No. You know what you're meant to know.
Call the President of the United States of America.
There you go, honey. - Elizabeth...
She is in so much denial.
What's going on? Look, Jake. The Knitting Factory fell through.
Let me guess. You want me to stay here, watch Benny, see what he's up to - fine.
It's Broward p. d. they're coming down 75.
He buzzes around looking over everybody's shoulder to check their progress.
I probably should've a long time ago, but I think I...
Will you give him one message for me?
My men are under orders to shoot intruders on sight when they remember them.
Michael, I want you to meet my brilliant, adorableparamedic boyfriend, Campbell.
I go once up and down the ward and three times round every landing.
I won't. I promise. I promise, I won’t. I love you. Yeah.
Uh-huh. Okay. So which one of them called you?
Well, it's the reason the sergeant called for an early landing and look where that got us.
But when you think about it within context that's when it sort of all comes together, the freakiness of the magnitude of what we're doing.
It's hard not to look where someone's firing, and gunshots are disorienting, especially at close range.
They're about Elizabeth, okay? I'm really sorry.
We're here for the chips -- the, uh, passport chips.
That's weird, not going to school.
Well, now it's my turn to tell you that. Oh.
That's what spies do, you know?
Oh, damn it. you know, that still hurts.
You know, it's not the same when no one's watching.
5, 4... - all right, I'll call!
you know, like a 60ish-year-old woman sitting in a car.
They're dead, they can't sue nobody.
Oh. Okay, it -- -- I'm sorry.
Cake! Cake! Cake! We only just started eating.
You just need a clean car, something to get you close so they don't know it's you.
My god, children have to listen to you-- my children
you know, I'm... look, I'm sorry.
Catherine? - I have to go, mom.
Don't tell me what I need. I'm calling the shots here.
I haven't really explored Miami very much.
Dion? What, you mean the video games and stuff?
For reasons I don't understand, you turned her down.
Yeah, u did. -- I did not.
Can't give up, Mum. Mustn't ever give up. Gotta fly!
I have a little medical bag to stitch minor wounds and pull splinters.
I... I'm not gonna tell you what you should do, but maybe you can think about who she is now.
Thank you. Tell 'em we're having dinner in here. They might want to join us.
Whoa, can you make anything grow?
She's not gonna kill me in public. Smile.
Octopuses are notoriously crafty and elusive.
She did it!  - It was her!
She looks like death eating a cracker.
What do you think I do, mom?
You ever see the movie?  - No.
Oh, Scotty, Rebecca, what brings you here?
and they lift right out of the water...
Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?
When I shot Card, it wasn't in self- defense.
Don't get cocky. - Nice shot.
Both calls made were made from Brooke's cell, which has since been turned off.
It's more like $45, 000 now.
Listen, Jake, this is not a job with a great future.
To better understand the origin of an alien planet teeming with these types of machines...
That's weird, not going to school.
Okay, don't leave till my exdrives out of the driveway. I'll call you.
I'll call Marsden out. - I'll tell him...
No. -So don't criticize people who are.
You just -- you just cheered us right up.
How? - By serving him up for me.
Okay, that's Fi. Throw the switches.
great. This is all I need.
I can only cook a few things, and the air-conditioning's iffy.
But now it just seems so surreal.
Okay, guys, the plan is to get under the boat and have a good
You think too much. Sometimes you've just gotta...
Mom, just-- - And this is him here. I'm gonna take the call.
Luckily, you can usually count on the other guy not to let you off easy.
He likes this shirt, doesn't ?
If that happens, we just flush 'em ourselves.
I didn't know that she really wanted to.
Um... Let's just say that we evolved.
Someone who just joined the team won't expect an equal cut of whatever you're stealing, and if they don't know your plans, they can't go to the cops.
You didn't take that to Home Ec, too, did you?
We're not gonna let Luc go without a great big fight.  - Four weeks?
Uh, well, Dr. Alex, I appreciate that kind of diligence, but not every mother has the time.
Sarah, she's your kid. So why don't you help her?
At least I can bear my own exile a while longer, knowing how Susannah's been safe in your care.
So now you can accuse Carter of being an undercover cop.
He was a lovely little boy... like you.
Please stand by to redirect to Fort Lauderdale. Over.
Oh, she's doing a girl scout camping weekend.
We drive off, we hand over Reed to the interrogators, and you go to work.

Right now, I'm gonna chop these, and nothing on earth is gonna stop me.
I know. I know. It always rings.
Who's Arlo? - I'm sure he's there every day for lunch.
Hey, rick appleton. - Justin Walker.
Staircase and hallway downstairs are clear.
Or did you not? - I don't... I don't remember a plan.
Olivia, do you think you could look at us when we talk to you?
Neither of us should be, because we are happy, and we're in love, and... Did you hear mom on the radio today?
Hopefully, we'll track the guy back to where the girls are before Katya gets her hand son a blowtorch.
You said Miami beach, right? That's where we're headed?
Damn it, Fuller! What's taking so long?
I swear to god, if I find out you're lying to me -This might not be what it looks like.
That's not the question, Mr. Axe.
Uh, I did some poking around the FBI.
Paparazzi? My god. The world has gone mad.

What kind of history? - Depression.
You want some hot coffee?  - Only in the worst way.
Sounds like Brennen's after some government-funded weapon.
Here you are. Not too light. Not too dark. Just right.
I need some backup, and Mike's mind is pretty much on this whole Cowan business.
I-I've been going over all these expenses from the wedding.

The last thing he would want you to do is stop living your life, and if you're trying to shame me into not wanting a comfortable future with you, then... then you're right, I don't understand.
Yeah, about that. I'm keeping Sam for a while.
You said you wanted it. - I do, I do. Oh, I do.
You got me out of the poorhouse, okay?
That's why I had to rush straight here from the airport?

Justin, it's also a very big step.  - Yeah, but you know you love him.

I have a daughter who is moving forward to the next stage of her life.
I need you to meet me at 9: 00 tomorrow morning at dad's old fishing spot - the one we went to when I was 12.
I thought she was our piece of luck, our miracle.
Hope your mom knows what she's doing, Mikey.
You tried, and it didn't work out, and that loss, or disappointment, as you put it, is just as real as Catherine's.
Oh, no, we've had that today, too.
Feel free to check all the stalls next time you go take a leak.
Whether you're in moscow, tehran, or miami, club girls are a good source of information.

Caleb, we might have a problem.
from the plant life to the larger, more complex creatures.
There's nothing but rubber gaskets here.
You are gonna look back and you're gonna think, how the hell could my mom have been so irresponsible?

I'm, uh, just thinking out loud here, but if I wanted to steal a really valuable object, going in as a helpful soulvolunteering to test it might be my first move.

Say bye to mama? - Bye bye. I'll see you soon.
I gotta see who this is. - Mom, your publicist can wait.

Her father, peter, a widower, left her home alone for the weekend.
Of course l'm right. Go get ready.
That is, bar none, the craziest play I have ever heard in the field.
I don't know what she knows, but it's probably a good idea for you two to steer clear of me for a while.
Well, I’ll buy the drinks. - then you can definitely sit your ass down.
Li, in good conscience, I can't
Trust me or don't. It's your choice.
Yeah, well, I was nearly chopped to bits, almost blown up, and was shot today.

Either way, we have to tell Madeline.
So, so, what's your name? -- Ken junior.
Kevin, your 4: 00 with Mr. Balanchine is here.
yeah, I'll take care of him.
Oh, apparently, your dear, deflowered little girl would've screwed my husband in a heartbeat.
Fine. I am here because I gave part of my liver to Elizabh.

You want a drink? -It depends.
You see, it's always at the end, when everything's coming together, that people start making desperate moves.
I didn't... nothing. I didn't... - What did you say about me?
Now you know how hard it is to love someone who doesn't love himself.
I'll help you choose a dress if you reconsider having another round of chemo.
And this is Rebecca lang and Ryan pewter Baugh with the cia's field division.
I'll get him to take me to Quinn.
Well, I'm fine. I-I have nothing to say.
Look, you guys should just leave, okay?
And, yes, I am going home to see my brother who just got back from iraq.
When I met you 30 years ago, you made me nervous, and 30 years ago, I was 30 years younger.
They had families at home, not Lena.
She is not. She's my friend.
He's in-- he in his mood, you know? Good to see you.

You know, I dug through nine subsidiaries in six countries.

God, is there some sort of presidential aftershave you're wearing?
Marriage is like a loaf of bread.
No, no, not just me. The team here did.
Sometimes you've got to get creative.
Hey, uh, I'm sorry to interrupt...
A human, weighing in at 175 pounds on Earth...
And, Luc, you come over here for a minute.
I am not gonna use any of that money unless I am guaranteed that she will get a decent return.
At least we'd look like we had a purpose.
It's just I'm happy to be with somebody...
Maybe he's in CIA custody, wishing he never met me.
He's got decent stamina, but everyone's got a breaking point, and I'm good at finding them.
You do anything stupid, I dump Sam's body in the swamp.
[Radio: Man] That's McFly, a new British invasion band
Listen, Riley, I guarantee you - Mike is not the bad guy here.
I've always wanted a night on the town in my scrubs.
Dear Wade, Ryan and little, tiny Emmit.
Frantic? Well, I am aging fast.
You just have to be patient, I guess.
Actually, I do, but not because I don't trust you.
I think we're upset because this happened on our watch.
on a pedestal platform that has scales underneath.
He gets to hang out and play video games all day.
How could the boy break our spell? He has no power.
Yeah. But let's not call it that.
Tough thing about what I do is I can't let my guard down.
To improvise a weapon, you have to understand the basic principle behind whatever you're making.
You know, Kevin, just because you always have to diet doesn't mean that you should make fun of pele who have a higher metabolism than you do.

What if david only wants me to move there because he feels responsible?
Miranda, hi! -- Nora! How are you, oh, my goodness.
I think we can make it. Come on.  - Okay. Kitty Mccallister, Senator, 2010.
At least Rebecca got a job offer.
It's about 50 pages. Ba - doomp.
I can handle myself, Michael. - I’m with fi on this one, Mike.
Where are the guys? I need a guy. I need a "Jack Marsden".
You're listening to Trey now, aren't you?
Oh, Amma, what are you doing?
And use my C. B. handle -- "Smoking Mama".
All right, you just start a little earlier. That's all. - All right.
It's easy to project. I'm not projecting, Michael.
The next minute you're over the sea. Exactly.
Who needs adrenaline? I'm practically spinning like a top.
I'll just wait up here until Bailey pokes his head out.
Sorry. I couldn't take the tension. - Thanks for that.
Guy like you might need a favor from the FBI someday.
Right? - Look at you moving up.
I was never good at taking orders, Sam.
Yes. I’m here to, uh, surrender.
Having a gun to your head is all about timing, finding the right moment to make your move.
People are usually too scared to even compete with me, you know?
Try accessing the U. S. counterterrorist databases, see if I can find something.
Hey, Don, first of all, that's not an old saying.
I promised Fiona that she wouldn't be involved in this.
Remember what that douche bag Drillbit taught us?
I, uh, I'm not sure how to say this to you.
Riley's coming after me now. She knows I'm helping you.
Oh, uh, well, Becky just loves paperwork, don't you, dear?
so that we could hear them...
No, he's gonna hurt more people – a lot more people.
The nanny story...is it ever gonna blow up in our face?
Michael's life is at stake, and all we have is a picture of a house?!
Why in the world would he do that?
Missed you at the shop today.
No. No, not literally. It... Thank god.
You want to see what we got for uncle Kevin?
I used two different types of metals-- copper and zinc.
You invited the entire neighbourhood? Are you insane?
they swoop down in hopes to not only drink...
is the whole tone your fiancee took when she called.
But he's a different story, solid.
What, like chicken soup? You know a hundred doctors.
She did not have them in high school.
they wait till it draws nearer and nearer...
Luc, Luc, Luc, that is a distinction that no one at this dinner party is able to make right now.
as desperately as you want to.
So I need everyone to go out the back way and head for the fence, and we need to go right now.
Just... I have a meeting with Pearce.
Hell, yes.  - Who's respondi?
Oh, my God, you see it's actually grabbing hold here.
I’m not afraid to pull a trigger if that's what has to happen.
So there's a rumor that Harold Simms is pushing for David and Richard to get the Karasz oil leases.
So, uh, it's all about the burn notice with you, isn't it?
God.  - Well, there is evil, Lena.

By the way, it seems like she packed up and left early.
I told you to stay away, Mikey.

Do you think this is cosmic payback for me and Kitty, for when we were
You got to have a little faith that Mike knows what he's doing.
And I have to tell you, you might think about telling your children the truth about ol' pepele pewover at my house, because if they ask me who he is, I'm not gonna lie to the you know what, mather? Just don't worry about it.
I think this one is really beautiful, but I think it makes me look flat-chested.
A friend of Nate's must have come by earlier.
Well, hurry up, 'cause I gotta get Trisha.
was that some sort of fraternity brother kind of thing?
I'm sorry. - I'm gonna go to work, and, yes, I will help Paige with her debate.
Madeline said she was sure you could take care of it.
And each bottle, with our new organic label...

Agent Pearce, you look like you could use a nap.
Come on, Wade! You're like Rocky! Get back out there!
Vanderwall, where have you been?! And what the hell happened out there?
You taught me that timing is everything, and it's a good story, right?
We've just got to watch him, because he's...
Somehow lately, it's all been feeling a little
I'm just afraid. When Dennis York wants something, he always finds a way of getting it.
So if you really want to help Westen, you'll help me.
You all right? - Yes, I'm...
Do you know that my nephew and his husband are about to become fathers?
Yes, mom, I've been going to my n. a. Meetings.
I'm sure that would be a happy ending.
The Turks sent out a second hitter.

Well, you are. - You mean, I was.
It's cold enough to crystallize the metal in many commercial locks.
We need to kill her radio now.
No, no. Just take me to Schmidt's house and patch me up.
How many times do I have to listen to her droning on about hanging curtains before I end up and hang myself?
Yeah, which she won't let me forget. You know what?
Just go with it! - Okay, Sarah, what are you talkin...
And when I'm done, you'll never have to worry about Timo again. Trust me.
As an employee of the U. S. government, I'm probably not supposed to say this, but...Wow.
Do it myself? - I got a gun.
Have you asked anybody yet? - No, but who would?
So thank you so much for calling.
These are animals with roots that pick up and slowly move across the planet surface and anchor themselves back down swaying in the wind...
She doesn't Facebook or Twitter, and D.J.
You you told him about the photos? I’m not even supposed to have these.
Well, no. What are you doing? What are you doing?
And all you're doing is alienating every single one of 'em.
No, no, Wait, wait, Try again.
We'd have been out of here 10 minutes ago if you didn't argue about every little thing.
I didn't mean to. I just...
Ethan Wate.  - Yeah, I know.
Now I got to kill my deals all my investors are lost.

Let me pull another one for you, okay?
Are you trying to keep me away from Campbell?
Now watch this. I'm just gonna break the wrist and walk away.
Some guy from the NSA. - The NSA has a leak? I want a name.
I take it you've never been tested before.
What? What is it? - Go. Just get in the car.
She hasn't got one yet. Mum and Dad haven't had time.
Or... you could walk back in there with your head held high
You know what this looks like now is an unexpected drop-in from Michael Weston.
Michael, I-I know I said that I would go along with youon this job, but I don't want youto work with strickler...
You've already decided that I've done something inappropriate, so why don't you just go ahead and punish me?
Not really. But it could be.
They didn't even have time to lock up.
I don't care what it is.
Yeah, but now is not the time to cut corners.
It's like squeezing juice from a stone.
Schmidt told you those passport chips were untraceable, right?
How far out are we? - Three minutes away.
Yeah, not so fast. I have a few conditions.
Yes! He has a samurai sword - he has used on his other victims!  - All right...

It's a little like being in high school.
I BEGAN SAILING FORTY YEARS AGO

Kevin, I can barely hear you.
So, he wanted Maya to move? Yes, but she didn't want to.
If you ever found, you know, a 100' Kraken that had the strength that an octopus has, that would just be an absolutely fearsome beast.

All right, I'm going to add the squid fins, but I'm going to keep the octopus arms just 'cause they
Slice 'em, dice 'em, rue 'em.
Give me those. - okay you need to ease up on the attitude.
So, um, you all have your menus.
Oh, Saul, Saul, you could marry him.  - Yeah, I could marry him.
She after an endorsement from Hix?
I don't have the time to put this little a. m.Radio thing in my life.
If those guys are planning on getting to her here, you're just gonna have to find another way, right? Thanks.
Their main vulnerability is that they depend on people's faith in padlocks.
Sam and Jesse are already inside.
It's not like that. - Yeah, really? It seems like that.
You want to live the rest of your life in a shack in cuba?
Sorry, but I just have to put my killer hook to the test and see how much damage it can do, something the esteemed novelist Victor Hugo contemplated back in 1866.
Sarah, the only person who had cancer in our family was Daisy.
You mean, with no clothes on? With his tackle hanging out?
How was it having all those little kids look up to you?
Wait, mom, how have I never seen this movie?
All it would take is a few pictures with the wrong woman...
Stay there. You turn around like this. Okay?
Enter Michael Westen, a.k. a.Matt Graham.
You didn't hear my children calling in trying to save their mother from embarrassing herself, did you?
I'll tell you where he is.
We're investigating an incident that occurred last week.
Jackson expected you to kill us.
Let me go! Help! - Stop fighting.
Fuller, do not take the shot. I repeat, do not take the shot.
I'll go along with whichever you decide.
Let's see what we can do, okay?
All you can do now is look towards the future.
Sarah and I are pretty convinced that Kevin is not gonna be coming to dinner.
David, look me in the eye.
Oh, Mike's in a bit of a bind.
Now are you gonna stand for his legacy to be slandered by these people?
On three. One, two... - Put the gun down.
I'm sorry ... which one? - Lemonade is good.
I'm not leaving you! Michael, I'm not afraid! - Mom, please!
Oh, Tuesday. - What, that's not good?
Thank you, that was... really sweet.
You think he reported us with telepathy?
It won't be long before they set up a perimeter and block the causeways.
The Mercury fulminate in a blasting cap gives you the perfect amount of explosive to send the message loud and clear without killing the vehicle or anyone in it.
Did I say, "big brains"? Maybe I should qualify that, Mr Coot.
Since I've got here, I've either been coddled like some half-wit or straight-out insulted.
And this is something I have to work through myself.
Luc, you said that you would keep an eye on him while I got changed.
We'll find out if you're lying right now.
I’m trying to reenact our—our first date.
If you have A. -I'll kill you.
Everybody knows - Do me a favor- shut up.
Hey. Hey, come on up here.
Well, I wish Kevin felt like that.
Kevin, don't be weird. - Sorry.

So far it's looking a lot like an octopus.
I just...I-I don't think I feel comfortable trying to convince him to take drugs.
Three men there. Password -- nihonto. Hurry!
It's because of her - Her... Vulnerability.
She felt like she had to not want to.
I do, okay? But I can't help it.
That's probably why William had you followed.
You did a lot of things I didn't understand.
You remember your old neighbor, Raymond Mosley, also known as sugar?
You know, I would keep him off the leg for a while, and he's gonna hate you, he's gonna fight you on it, but it's best if he doesn't put any pressure on it for at least two weeks.
So...think about what your mom would tell you.
Two boring hours of driving later, even the sharpest killing machine  lets down his guard.
Maybe you should draw me a picture of the map to that park.
Just take them. They'll make you feel better.
Listen, um, antiques lover, I...I hate to say this, but it sounds to me like you and your girlfriend are just... Not a good match.
Maybe we can put something together and blow through one of these walls.
But it was always about William Walker and nothing else.
all right. Look, I'm gonna go help mommy.
W... well, yes, Robert, of course. That's what we're doing here.
Then why don't you go make us some tea?
I don't know who or why, but it's the only explanation, 'cause your men are the only ones with access.
Madeline, it's good to hear your voice.
This should make you feel better，it's gonna take time to make sense of the information.
Would you like to sit down, Olivia?
Imagineyour white blood cellsare hurtling towards a cancer cell"...
Well, then, we'll have to think of something clever, Sam.
That didn't always sit right with Kelly.
