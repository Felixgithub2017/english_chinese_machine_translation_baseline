you know , you just do things in a clump
well , i better get going . but i got just one thing to say .
barry , i heard about your ex .
i 'm bored just hearing about it .
i 'm passing the ipsec , sending you the i . p. address now .
it sends us their data and wipes their drives clean .

i appreciate all of your opinions , but i 've told you a million times , i will not win playing dirty .

it 's good . we 're covered . don 't sweat it .
and she needs your help , man .

uh-huh . okay . so which one of them called you ?
well , it 's the reason the sergeant called for an early landing and look where that got us .
but when you think about it within context that 's when it sort of all comes together , the freakiness of the magnitude of what we 're doing .

if you let me go , me and my people will find you and only kill you .
mike , at the risk of getting a beat-down , can you tell me what the hell 's going on ?
how can you keep telling kitty to risk and do scary things if you 're not prepared to take risks yourself ?
welcome to the family , my darling , special girl .
i told you what you wanted to hear .
you want a drink ? -it depends .
you see , it 's always at the end , when everything 's coming together , that people start making desperate moves .
i didn 't ... nothing . i didn 't ... - what did you say about me ?
now you know how hard it is to love someone who doesn 't love himself .
i 'll help you choose a dress if you reconsider having another round of chemo .
and this is rebecca lang and ryan pewter baugh with the cia 's field division .
i 'll get him to take me to quinn .
well , i 'm fine . i-i have nothing to say .
look , you guys should just leave , okay ?
and , yes , i am going home to see my brother who just got back from iraq .
when i met you 30 years ago , you made me nervous , and 30 years ago , i was 30 years younger .
they had families at home , not lena .

marriage is like a loaf of bread .
no , no , not just me . the team here did .
sometimes you 've got to get creative .
hey , uh , i 'm sorry to interrupt ...
a human , weighing in at 175 pounds on earth ...
and , luc , you come over here for a minute .
i am not gonna use any of that money unless i am guaranteed that she will get a decent return .
at least we 'd look like we had a purpose .
it 's just i 'm happy to be with somebody ...
maybe he 's in cia custody , wishing he never met me .
he 's got decent stamina , but everyone 's got a breaking point , and i 'm good at finding them .
you do anything stupid , i dump sam 's body in the swamp .
[ radio : man ] that 's mcfly , a new british invasion band
listen , riley , i guarantee you - mike is not the bad guy here .
i 've always wanted a night on the town in my scrubs .
dear wade , ryan and little , tiny emmit .
frantic ? well , i am aging fast .
you just have to be patient , i guess .
actually , i do , but not because i don 't trust you .
i think we 're upset because this happened on our watch .
on a pedestal platform that has scales underneath .
he gets to hang out and play video games all day .
how could the boy break our spell ? he has no power .
yeah . but let 's not call it that .
tough thing about what i do is i can 't let my guard down .
to improvise a weapon , you have to understand the basic principle behind whatever you 're making .
you know , kevin , just because you always have to diet doesn 't mean that you should make fun of pele who have a higher metabolism than you do .
is that you 're her father . so ...

miranda , hi ! -- nora ! how are you , oh , my goodness .
i think we can make it . come on . - okay . kitty mccallister , senator , 2010 .

where are the guys ? i need a guy . i need a " jack marsden " .
you 're listening to trey now , aren 't you ?
oh , amma , what are you doing ?
and use my c . b. handle -- " smoking mama " .
all right , you just start a little earlier . that 's all . - all right .
it 's easy to project . i 'm not projecting , michael .
the next minute you 're over the sea . exactly .
who needs adrenaline ? i 'm practically spinning like a top .
i 'll just wait up here until bailey pokes his head out .
sorry . i couldn 't take the tension . - thanks for that .
guy like you might need a favor from the fbi someday .
right ? - look at you moving up .
i was never good at taking orders , sam .
yes . i ’ m here to , uh , surrender .
having a gun to your head is all about timing , finding the right moment to make your move .
people are usually too scared to even compete with me , you know ?
try accessing the u . s. counterterrorist databases , see if i can find something .
hey , don , first of all , that 's not an old saying .
i promised fiona that she wouldn 't be involved in this .
remember what that douche bag drillbit taught us ?
i , uh , i 'm not sure how to say this to you .
riley 's coming after me now . she knows i 'm helping you .
oh , uh , well , becky just loves paperwork , don 't you , dear ?
so that we could hear them ...
no , he 's gonna hurt more people – a lot more people .
the nanny story ... is it ever gonna blow up in our face ?
michael 's life is at stake , and all we have is a picture of a house ? !
why in the world would he do that ?
missed you at the shop today .
no . no , not literally . it ... thank god .
you want to see what we got for uncle kevin ?
i used two different types of metals-- copper and zinc .
you invited the entire neighbourhood ? are you insane ?
they swoop down in hopes to not only drink ...
is the whole tone your fiancee took when she called .
but he 's a different story , solid .
what , like chicken soup ? you know a hundred doctors .
she did not have them in high school .
they wait till it draws nearer and nearer ...
luc , luc , luc , that is a distinction that no one at this dinner party is able to make right now .
as desperately as you want to .
so i need everyone to go out the back way and head for the fence , and we need to go right now .
just ... i have a meeting with pearce .
hell , yes . - who 's respondi ?
oh , my god , you see it 's actually grabbing hold here .
i ’ m not afraid to pull a trigger if that 's what has to happen .
so there 's a rumor that harold simms is pushing for david and richard to get the karasz oil leases .
so , uh , it 's all about the burn notice with you , isn 't it ?
god . - well , there is evil , lena .
i knew it . we don 't have the right specs .
and we 'll give him whatever he wants .
by the way , it seems like she packed up and left early .
i told you to stay away , mikey .
collect under the sands from the sparse rainfall .
do you think this is cosmic payback for me and kitty , for when we were
you got to have a little faith that mike knows what he 's doing .
and i have to tell you , you might think about telling your children the truth about ol ' pepele pewover at my house , because if they ask me who he is , i 'm not gonna lie to the you know what , mather ? just don 't worry about it .
i think this one is really beautiful , but i think it makes me look flat-chested .
a friend of nate 's must have come by earlier .
well , hurry up , ' cause i gotta get trisha .
was that some sort of fraternity brother kind of thing ?
i 'm sorry . - i 'm gonna go to work , and , yes , i will help paige with her debate .
madeline said she was sure you could take care of it .
and each bottle , with our new organic label ...
if we can get evidence linking him to the heroin , we can do our own blackmail

agent pearce , you look like you could use a nap .
come on , wade ! you 're like rocky ! get back out there !
vanderwall , where have you been ? ! and what the hell happened out there ?
you taught me that timing is everything , and it 's a good story , right ?
we 've just got to watch him , because he 's ...
somehow lately , it 's all been feeling a little
i 'm just afraid . when dennis york wants something , he always finds a way of getting it .
so if you really want to help westen , you 'll help me .
you all right ? - yes , i 'm ...
do you know that my nephew and his husband are about to become fathers ?
yes , mom , i 've been going to my n. a . meetings .
i 'm sure that would be a happy ending .
the turks sent out a second hitter .
i 'm sure . i 'm sure . i 'm sure .
it could very well take it to one side and turn it and so the boat fills with water
what ? why ... why are you giving me that face ?
well , you are . - you mean , i was .
it 's cold enough to crystallize the metal in many commercial locks .
we need to kill her radio now .
no , no . just take me to schmidt 's house and patch me up .
how many times do i have to listen to her droning on about hanging curtains before i end up and hang myself ?
yeah , which she won 't let me forget . you know what ?
just go with it ! - okay , sarah , what are you talkin ...
and when i 'm done , you 'll never have to worry about timo again . trust me .
as an employee of the u . s. government , i 'm probably not supposed to say this , but ... wow .
do it myself ? - i got a gun .
have you asked anybody yet ? - no , but who would ?
so thank you so much for calling .
these are animals with roots that pick up and slowly move across the planet surface and anchor themselves back down swaying in the wind ...
she doesn 't facebook or twitter , and d.j.
you you told him about the photos ? i ’ m not even supposed to have these .
well , no . what are you doing ? what are you doing ?
and all you 're doing is alienating every single one of ' em .
no , no , wait , wait , try again .
we 'd have been out of here 10 minutes ago if you didn 't argue about every little thing .
i didn 't mean to . i just ...
ethan wate . - yeah , i know .
now i got to kill my deals all my investors are lost .
wh-why would you ask me that ? that 's crazy .

johnnie walker blue on the rocks for me and my friend here .

i take it you 've never been tested before .
what ? what is it ? - go . just get in the car .
she hasn 't got one yet . mum and dad haven 't had time .
or ... you could walk back in there with your head held high
you know what this looks like now is an unexpected drop-in from michael weston .
michael , i-i know i said that i would go along with youon this job , but i don 't want youto work with strickler ...
you 've already decided that i 've done something inappropriate , so why don 't you just go ahead and punish me ?
not really . but it could be .
they didn 't even have time to lock up .
i don 't care what it is .
yeah , but now is not the time to cut corners .
it 's like squeezing juice from a stone .
schmidt told you those passport chips were untraceable , right ?
how far out are we ? - three minutes away .
yeah , not so fast . i have a few conditions .
yes ! he has a samurai sword - he has used on his other victims ! - all right ...
mom shouldn 't drive herself down there . she 'll break the land speed record .
it 's a little like being in high school .
i began sailing forty years ago
now , until we find out whether or not mr . cahill was working alone , we will assume that our radios have been compromised . is that clear ?
what , you don 't think amy -- i mean , come on , she 's , like , my special lady .
kevin , i can barely hear you .
so , he wanted maya to move ? yes , but she didn 't want to .
if you ever found , you know , a 100 ' kraken that had the strength that an octopus has , that would just be an absolutely fearsome beast .
yeah , well , that was 10-plus years ago , and i 'm still not over it .
all right , i 'm going to add the squid fins , but i 'm going to keep the octopus arms just ' cause they
slice ' em , dice ' em , rue ' em .
give me those . - okay you need to ease up on the attitude .
so , um , you all have your menus .
oh , saul , saul , you could marry him . - yeah , i could marry him .
she after an endorsement from hix ?
i don 't have the time to put this little a. m.radio thing in my life .
if those guys are planning on getting to her here , you 're just gonna have to find another way , right ? thanks .
their main vulnerability is that they depend on people 's faith in padlocks .
sam and jesse are already inside .
it 's not like that . - yeah , really ? it seems like that .
you want to live the rest of your life in a shack in cuba ?
sorry , but i just have to put my killer hook to the test and see how much damage it can do , something the esteemed novelist victor hugo contemplated back in 1866 .
sarah , the only person who had cancer in our family was daisy .
you mean , with no clothes on ? with his tackle hanging out ?
how was it having all those little kids look up to you ?
wait , mom , how have i never seen this movie ?
all it would take is a few pictures with the wrong woman ...
stay there . you turn around like this . okay ?
enter michael westen , a.k. a.matt graham .
you didn 't hear my children calling in trying to save their mother from embarrassing herself , did you ?
i 'll tell you where he is .

jackson expected you to kill us .
let me go ! help ! - stop fighting .
fuller , do not take the shot . i repeat , do not take the shot .
i 'll go along with whichever you decide .
let 's see what we can do , okay ?
all you can do now is look towards the future .
sarah and i are pretty convinced that kevin is not gonna be coming to dinner .
david , look me in the eye .
oh , mike 's in a bit of a bind .
now are you gonna stand for his legacy to be slandered by these people ?
on three . one , two ... - put the gun down .
i 'm sorry ... which one ? - lemonade is good .
i 'm not leaving you ! michael , i 'm not afraid ! - mom , please !
oh , tuesday . - what , that 's not good ?
thank you , that was ... really sweet .
you think he reported us with telepathy ?
it won 't be long before they set up a perimeter and block the causeways .
the mercury fulminate in a blasting cap gives you the perfect amount of explosive to send the message loud and clear without killing the vehicle or anyone in it .
did i say , " big brains " ? maybe i should qualify that , mr coot .
since i 've got here , i 've either been coddled like some half-wit or straight-out insulted .
and this is something i have to work through myself .
luc , you said that you would keep an eye on him while i got changed .
we 'll find out if you 're lying right now .
i ’ m trying to reenact our — our first date .
if you have a . -i 'll kill you .
everybody knows - do me a favor- shut up .
hey . hey , come on up here .
well , i wish kevin felt like that .
kevin , don 't be weird . - sorry .
he 's like all the men in my life .
so far it 's looking a lot like an octopus .
i just ... i-i don 't think i feel comfortable trying to convince him to take drugs .
three men there . password -- nihonto . hurry !
it 's because of her - her ... vulnerability .
she felt like she had to not want to .
i do , okay ? but i can 't help it .
that 's probably why william had you followed .
you did a lot of things i didn 't understand .
you remember your old neighbor , raymond mosley , also known as sugar ?
you know , i would keep him off the leg for a while , and he 's gonna hate you , he 's gonna fight you on it , but it 's best if he doesn 't put any pressure on it for at least two weeks .
so ... think about what your mom would tell you .
two boring hours of driving later , even the sharpest killing machine lets down his guard .
maybe you should draw me a picture of the map to that park .
just take them . they 'll make you feel better .
listen , um , antiques lover , i ... i hate to say this , but it sounds to me like you and your girlfriend are just ... not a good match .
maybe we can put something together and blow through one of these walls .
but it was always about william walker and nothing else .
all right . look , i 'm gonna go help mommy .
w ... well , yes , robert , of course . that 's what we 're doing here .
then why don 't you go make us some tea ?
i don 't know who or why , but it 's the only explanation , ' cause your men are the only ones with access .
madeline , it 's good to hear your voice .
this should make you feel better ， it 's gonna take time to make sense of the information .
would you like to sit down , olivia ?
imagineyour white blood cellsare hurtling towards a cancer cell " ...
well , then , we 'll have to think of something clever , sam .
that didn 't always sit right with kelly .
you just figure a way to get there . i 'm on it . thanks , mike .
holly . just out of curiosity , when we last spoke , um ,
now that i know your side of the story , i want you to know ...
the guy who studied it most is steve o 'shea , an authority on all things squid .
of course , that 's the same reason that spies live in fear of the day they accidentally accuse one of the good guys
justin . - i ’ m kidding . you 're gonna be amazing .
they 're into the whole carrot-and-stick thing , and ...
you said he worked in maintenance .
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls .
but you guys don 't know who i am .
what do you think he would do if he found out about this ?
relax . the tracker says they 're getting to the motel right about now .
um , really ? that 's funny . ' cause i think i just heard you talking .
i thought we agreed - fiona , it 's like i told you before .
a warehouse door is going to be reinforced , but the walls aren 't .
she said robert 's gonna be all right .
come on , man , look , we know you brought dion 's items into the pawnshop .
riley took him into custody and threw out the rule book .
look , i was hoping to get you home in a couple days , but that doesn 't look like it 's gonna happen .
what , you think i 'm taking you to quinn ?
damn it ! - can we stop it ? just stick something in it ?
and i can 't imagine how it feels for them .
i would be very careful if i were you about maki this any worse .
yeah . so you wanna grab some lunch or something ?
i was the chick singer , and i never really knew what to do with my hands , so i picked up a guitar and learned enough chords to fake it , but that 's about it .
what are you insane ? we 're not going anywhere near there .
ah , i looked for you at the announcement .
knock it off , both of you !
you cooperate -- i 'll let you live . you don 't
this is scary as hell , dude .
okay . yep , do it . thank you .

i 'd like to , but i don 't know why i should help myron .
his name is tyler brennen , a black-market trader .
oh , great . we 'll call him vinny .
fuller called from the control tower .
you got a better idea ? -yeah .
but i 'll never make enough money for her , so i 'll start drinking ...
good one , ron ! - come on !
she died while i was in here .
what are you talking about ? i have ... i have directed a staff .
yeah , believe it or not , it is the approved name - for the hormone that causes our fight-or-flight response.- really ?
i 'm already hearing this crap about kitty using my plane to campaign around the state .
he 's our best chance to get wilson . without him , we got nothing .

uncle abner , we are in need of your intercession .
jus ! - well , if it isn 't tiny tim .
i 'm-- i 'm really sorry . - no , no , fine , go .
i was hoping ... you could ... put your snow globes on it .
mike 's got to be meeting with quinn just up the street here ,
mike , look , i can sweeten the pot on this .
signal 's coming from right over there where that garbage can is .
you know , i drove him everywhere .
he could have trouble walking , running ...
you try to escape , nate dies .
because when one door closes two others open .
she has her own line . she 's looking for investors .
they took everything that she has .
a speckled brown animal with a broad head and arms that fluctuate like seaweed .
first , we get out of here , then i 'll figure out what 's next .
oh . no , no , no. l couldn 't . no . no . honestly , l think you should have it .
i know that you 're used to this , but this isn 't my bag of tea , you know ?

maybe you 're not trying to move on .
fi , i ’ m not losing my mind .

i 'm going to get up now , okay ?
how about i erase all the question marks from your once-sterling record , get you back into cifa with a clean slate ?
all right . he 's handsome in an obvious sort of way . but that 's no reason to act like a bunch of teenagers .
i 'll get you in a minute , yeah can you please tell me what the hell is going on in here ?
no , i just know the feeling .
to make it all about me .
because i ’ ve always known your heart .

it ... it doesn 't matter what it is .
sam , riley 's here . she 's sending some guys your way .

it 's just ... the pills i took for--for the headache , which … i really did have .
she has no love for you .
there were unseasonably strong gusts from the east ...
